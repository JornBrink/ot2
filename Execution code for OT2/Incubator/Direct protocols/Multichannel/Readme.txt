changelog:
- can now use multichannel
- For now locks pipl as 300m (multichannel) and pipr as 300 (singlechannel) but direct protocols can not ask for input for now (check with Opentron)
- Is updated from P300 direct protocol so eppendorfs are still at 17 mm or 5mm from the bottem (might change later)
