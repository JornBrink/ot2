This indirect protocol is working and uses Pipr and Pipl (looking for left and right pipette and user inputs)
Changes:
- Pipr --> asks what pipette is attached to the right
- Pipl --> asks what pipette is attached to the left
- Added reservoir as possible source well
- Added option to dilute inside wells --> command lines can now recognise source well == 8 and target well == 8 and use the multichannel
